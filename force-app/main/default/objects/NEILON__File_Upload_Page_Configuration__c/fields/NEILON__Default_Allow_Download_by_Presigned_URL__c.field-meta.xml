    <description>We have a field called &quot;Download URL&quot; in our S3-File object. This field is being used to store AWS link for each S3-File. We auto populate this field for each S3-File record. If you don&apos;t want to auto populate AWS link in Download URL field, you can uncheck a checkbox called Allow Download by Presigned URL Only in S3-File. So if you want to disable it by default for all new S3-Files, you can uncheck this checkbox.</description>
