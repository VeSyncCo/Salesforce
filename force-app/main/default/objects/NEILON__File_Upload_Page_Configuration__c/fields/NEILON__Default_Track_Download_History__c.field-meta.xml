    <description>In S3-Link, we have a feature to track downloads and views of S3-Files by users inside your Salesforce org. You can enable that feature at the S3-File record level by checking &quot;Track Download History&quot; in S3-File. So if you want to enable it by default for all new S3-Files, you can check this checkbox. We have another object called S3-File Download History and with download and view tracking enabled, we create S3-File Download History record when someone in your Salesforce org will download / view the file.</description>
